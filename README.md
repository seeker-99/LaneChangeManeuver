This is a python based animation created using Matploblib.
Showing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm applied on Autonomous Vehicle performing a lane change maneuver on different trajectories.
The MCP acts as a closed loop feedback for the vehicle and attempts to reduce the deviation of the car from actual intended path to achieve a perfect maneuver along the trajectory.
